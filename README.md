# SALES_AND_ANALYSIS

⦁	This project showcases all the steps (from scratch) taken to solve a machine learning problem. For your understanding, I've taken a simple yet challenging data set where you can engineer features at your discretion as well.
⦁	We will collect data from stores and make prediction on that gathering data.
⦁	From these data we will analyse the profit and loss on that data and analyse that what kind of data will benefit for which season.

# PROJECT_DETAILS


⦁	Understand the problem: Before getting the data, we need to understand the problem we are trying to solve. 

⦁	Data Exploration: It involves creating charts, graphs  and cross-tables to understand the behavior of features.

⦁	*Data Preprocessing: *Here, we impute missing values and clean string variables (remove space, irregular tabs, data time format) and anything that shouldn't be there. 

⦁	Model Testing: Finally, we test the model on the unseen data (test data) set.

⦁	Model Training: Using a suitable algorithm, we train the model on the given data set.
Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, we evaluate the model's performance using a suitable error metric
